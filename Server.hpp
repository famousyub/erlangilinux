/*
 * Server.hpp
 *
 * EventServer is a simple C++ TCP socket server implementation,
 * to serve as an example to anyone who wants to learn it.
 * It can interface with the rest of your program using three callback functions.
 * - onConnect, which fires when a new client connects. the client's fd is passed.
 * - onDisconnect, which fires when a client disconnects. passes fd.
 * - onInput, fires when input is received from a client. passes fd and char*
 *
 * define SERVER_DEBUG to spew out some juicy debug data!
 *
 * Original work by Gydo194, BSD 3-clause license below applies.
 * 
 * For an usage example, see the following project: https://github.com/Gydo194/server
 *
 * Use with neccesary caution, this code has not been audited or tested for performance problems, security holes, memory leaks etc.
